The User-Pays Model means your users cover their own cloud and AI usage. Instead of you, as a developer, paying for servers and APIs, users bring and pay for their own AI, storage and other features you've built into your application, making your app practically free to run!

When users interact with your Puter.js-powered apps, they handle their own resource consumption. This means you can include powerful features without worrying about the costs; whether you have 1 or 1 million users, you pay nothing for the infrastructure to run your application.

## User-Pays Model vs. Traditional Model

With user-pays model, each user covers for what they use through their own account. When you build with Puter.js, users log in with their Puter account and all their usage from storage, compute, API calls, gets billed to them, not you. You can launch your app with zero infrastructure costs. No server bills, no scaling costs, no surprise charges when your app goes viral.

Different from the traditional model, where you have to set up servers, databases, and cloud services before you even launch. If you're using AWS or Google Cloud, you configure everything, manage API keys, and handle billing. Moreover, you pay for everything your users do. Every file they upload, every API call they make, every database queryâ€”it all comes out of your pocket. The more users you get, the higher your bill.

## Advantages of the User-Pays Model

**1. Zero Server, AI, and APIs Costs**

The most significant advantage is that, as a developer, you don't pay any infrastructure costs when using Puter.js. Whether your app serves one user or one million users, your costs remain the same: zero. Practically infinite scalability at no cost.

**2. No API Keys Needed**

The User-Pays Model makes true serverless architecture a reality. You don't need to:

- Manage various AI and cloud services
- Worry about securing your API keys usage
- Ask users to bring their own API keys

**3. Built-in Security**

The authentication and authorization are handled by Puter's infrastructure:

- Users authenticate directly with Puter
- Your app operates within the permissions granted by the user
- Data is protected through Puter's security mechanisms

**4. No Anti-Abuse Implementation Required**

You don't need to implement:

- Rate limiting
- CAPTCHA verification
- IP blocking
- Usage quotas
- Fraud detection

Bad actors have no incentive to abuse the system because they are paying for their own usage.

**5. Simpler Codebase**

Since cloud, AI, and other APIs are all handled through Puter.js:

- Your codebase is significantly simpler
- You can focus entirely on your application's unique functionality
- Frontend-only development is possible for many applications

**6. Simplified User Experience**

For your users:

- Single sign-on through Puter
- Unified billing through their existing Puter account
- No need to create accounts with multiple service providers

## Everybody wins!

The User-Pays Model enables you to build advanced applications with AI, cloud storage, and auth, all from the frontend, without worrying about infrastructure, security, or scaling. It's a win-win situation where developers can ship without the cloud services costs, and users only covering for what they use.
